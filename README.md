# Photonic

...is a little 3d game, developed using the Unreal engine, for the Global Game Jam in 2017.

## Story

In the future, you are a sentient photon travelling through a huge
particle accellerator. Will you be able to reach your final destination?

## Gameplay

You can switch between the states of particle and wave.
As a particle you travel very fast and cannot steer much.
As a wave you can change your direction more easily --
so become a wave to avoid obstacles and sharp corners --,
but take care: time spent as a wave diminishes your energy level.
